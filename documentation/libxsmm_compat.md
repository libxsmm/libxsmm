# Compatibility

It is desirable to exercise portability and reliability of LIBXSMM's source code even on Non-Intel Architecture by the means of compilation, linkage, and generic tests. This section is *not* about Intel Architecture (or compatible). Successful compilation (or even running some of the tests successfully) does not mean LIBXSMM is valuable on that platform.

Make sure to rely on `PLATFORM=1`, otherwise a compilation error should occur _Intel Architecture or compatible CPU required!_ This error avoids (automated) attempts to upstream LIBXSMM to an unsupported platform. LIBXSMM is upstreamed for Intel Architecture on all major Linux distributions, FreeBSD, and others. If compilation fails with "_LIBXSMM is only supported on a 64-bit platform!_", `make PLATFORM=1 DBG=1` can be used to exercise compilation.

If platform support is forced (`PLATFORM=1`), runtime code generation is disabled at compile-time (`JIT=0`). Runtime code generation can be also enabled (`PLATFORM=1 JIT=1`) but code-dispatch will still return NULL-kernels. However, some tests will start failing as missing JIT-support it is not signaled at compile-time as with `JIT=0`.

**Note**: JIT-support normally guarantees a non-NULL code pointer ("kernel") if the request is according to the [limitations](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/wiki/Q&A#what-is-a-small-matrix-multiplication) (user-code is not asked to check for a NULL-kernel), which does not hold true if JIT is enabled on a platform that does not implement it.

## Linux

All Linux distributions are meant to be fully supported (please [report](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/issues/new) any compatibility issue). A shared library (`STATIC=0`) necessarily implies some performance hit when accessing thread-local memory (contended multicore execution). The GNU Compiler Collection prior to v5.1 may imply performance hits in some CPUID-dispatched code paths (non-JIT).

> In case of outdated Binutils, compilation can fail to assemble code that originates from code sections using Intrinsics (see issue [#170](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/issues/170) and [#212](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/issues/212#issuecomment-394620082)). To resolve the problem, please use `INTRINSICS=1` along with the desired target e.g., `AVX=3 MIC=0`, or `AVX=2`.

## CRAY

In addition to the regular Linux support, The CRAY Compiling Environment (CCE) is supported: Intel Compiler as well as the GNU Compiler Collection are detected even when invoked per CCE, and the CRAY compiler is likely configured to build for the architecture of the compute nodes and hence the compiler is sufficiently treated without specific build flags (`COMPATIBLE=1` is implicitly set). The CCE may suppress to build a shared library (`STATIC=0`), which also affects the TRACE facility (requires dynamic linkage even for static archives).

```bash
make CXX=CC CC=cc FC=ftn
```

The compatibility settings imply minor issues when using the CRAY compiler: full control and [customization](http://libxsmm.readthedocs.io/libxsmm_tune/) is not implemented, enabling symbols (`SYM=1`) appears to imply an unoptimized debug-build (due to the `-g` flag being present). Some sample codes/benchmarks enable symbols but are meant to not enable debug-code. The LIBXSMM library however is built without symbols by default.

## Windows

### Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows is [supported](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/wiki/Q&A#what-operating-systems-are-covered-by-libxsmm-and-what-about-microsoft-windows) using the Microsoft Visual Studio environment (no `make`). It is advised to review the build settings. However, the following configurations are available: `debug`, `release`, and release mode with `symbols`. JIT-code generation is enabled but limited to the MM domain (GEMM kernels and matcopy kernels; no transpose kernels). GEMM kernels with prefetch signature remain as non-prefetch kernels i.e., prefetch locations are ignored due to the effort of fully supporting the Windows calling convention. As a workaround and to properly preserve caller-state, each JIT-kernel call may be wrapped by an own function.

### Cygwin

Cygwin (non-MinGW) is fully supported. Please note, that all limitations of Microsoft Windows apply.

```bash
make
```

LIBXSMM can be built as a static library as well as a dynamic link library (STATIC=0).

### MinGW/Cygwin

This is about the Cygwin-hosted bits of MinGW. The `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` compiler flag is automatically applied. Please note, that all limitations of Microsoft Windows apply.

```bash
make \
  CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ \
  CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  FC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gfortran
```

To run tests, `BLAS=0` may be supplied (since Cygwin does not seem to provide BLAS-bits for the MinGW part). However, this may be different for "native" MinGW, or can be fixed by supplying a BLAS library somehow else.

### MinGW

This is about the "native" MinGW environment. Please note, there is the original [MinGW](https://iplogger.com/2FpaR4) as well as a [fork](https://iplogger.com/2FpaR4) (made in 2007). Both of which can target Windows 64-bit. Here, the [MSYS2 installer](https://iplogger.com/2FpaR4) (scroll down on that page to see the full installation instructions) has been used (see the [details](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation) on how to install missing packages).

```bash
pacman -S msys/make msys/python msys/diffutils \
  mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran \
  mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-openblas
```

Similar to Cygwin/MinGW, the `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` flag is automatically applied.

```bash
make
```

LIBXSMM can be built as a static library as well as a dynamic link library (`STATIC=0`).

## ARM

### AArch64

LIBXSMM 2.0 is the initial version supporting AArch64 (baseline is v8.1), which practically covers ARM 64-bit architecture from embedded and mobile to supercomputers. The build and installation process of LIBXSMM is the same as for Intel Architecture (IA) and the library can be natively compiled or cross-compiled. The latter for instance looks like:

```bash
make PLATFORM=1 AR=aarch64-linux-gnu-ar \
  FC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gfortran \
  CXX=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ \
  CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
```

### Cross-compilation

ARM AArch64 is regularly [supported](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/wiki/Compatibility#arm-aarch64). However, 32-bit ARM requires `PLATFORM=1` to unlock compilation (like 32-bit Intel Architecture). Unlocking compilation for 32-bit ARM is not confused with supporting 32-bit ARM architectures.

```bash
make PLATFORM=1 AR=arm-linux-gnueabi-ar \
  FC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gfortran \
  CXX=arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ \
  CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc
```

## Apple macOS

LIBXSMM for macOS is supported (i.e., qualifying a release) including AArch64 or Apple Silicon. The default is to rely on Apple's Clang based (platform-)compiler ("gcc"). However, GNU GCC in general as well as the Intel Compiler for macOS (only x86-64) can be used.

## FreeBSD

LIBXSMM is occasionally tested under FreeBSD. For libxsmmext, it is necessary to install OpenMP (`sudo pkg install openmp`).

```bash
bash
gmake
```
An attempt to run the [tests](https://github.com/libxsmm/libxsmm/wiki/Validation) may ask for a LAPACK/BLAS installation (unless `BLAS=0` is given). Both, Netlib BLAS (reference) and OpenBLAS are available (in case of linker error due to the GNU Fortran runtime library, one can try `gmake CXX=g++7 CC=gcc7 FC=gfortran7` i.e., select a consistent tool chain and adjust `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` accordingly e.g., `/usr/local/lib/gcc7`).

## PGI Compiler

The PGI Compiler&#160;2019 (and later) is supported. Earlier versions were only occasionally tested and automatically enabled the `COMPATIBLE=1` and `INTRINSIC=0` settings. Still, atomic builtins seem incomplete (at least with `pgcc`) hence LIBXSMM built with PGI Compiler is not fully thread-safe (tests/threadsafety can fail). Support for GNU's libatomic has been incorporated mainly for PGI but is also missing built-in compiler support hence supposedly atomic operations are mapped to normal (non-atomic) code sequences (`LIBXSMM_SYNC_SYSTEM`).

```bash
make CXX=pgc++ CC=pgcc FC=pgfortran
```

## IBM XL Compiler for Linux (POWER)

The POWER platform requires `PLATFORM=1` to unlock compilation.

```bash
make PLATFORM=1 CC=xlc CXX=xlc++ FC=xlf
```

## TinyCC

The Tiny C Compiler (TinyCC) supports Intel Architecture but lacks at least support for thread-local storage (TLS).

```bash
make CC=tcc THREADS=0 INTRINSICS=0 VLA=0 ASNEEDED=0 BLAS=0 FORCE_CXX=0
```
