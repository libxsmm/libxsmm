# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

LIBXSMM is distributed as source code package. In case of an issue, please report at https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm/issues. There is no formal commitment to update an existing release. Please feel free to write down such an expectation as part of the issue report!

Determine accurate build information in case of an upstreamed package (binary distribution):

```bash
export LIBXSMM_DUMP_BUILD=1
./application_linked_with_libxsmm ...
```

Build information is available when LIBXSMM was dynamically or statically linked with an application (not for header-only).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any kind of issue at https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm/issues or leave a reference to a report made elsewhere.
