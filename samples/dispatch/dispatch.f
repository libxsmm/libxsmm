! This (micro-)benchmark is a simplified variant of the C implementation;
! the main point of dispatch.f is to show compatibility with FORTRAN 77.
! NOTE: CPU_TIME is a Fortran 96 intrinsic, libxsmm_xmmdispatch must be
! called with all arguments when relying on FORTRAN 77.
!
! IMPORTANT: please use the type-safe F2003 interface (libxsmm.f or module)
!            unless FORTRAN 77 compatibility is really needed!
